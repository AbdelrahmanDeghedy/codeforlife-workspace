# Contributing as Developer

## What we need from you

Incoming contributor will need some or all of the following skills:

* Basic understanding of modern web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Intermediate Python and Django programming
* Familiarity with git or other source control

{% hint style="info" %}
You **do not** have to be familiar with all the technologies above, as long as you are keen to learn. If you primarily want to work on the front end, you may not need to know Python. And if you primarily want to work on the back end, you may not need to know Javascript.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Familiarity with the following is not required, but would be highly beneficial:

* Modern JS framework (we use React at some parts)
* Unit tests, TDD (Test Driven Development) and code review process
* Containerisation technology such as Docker and Kubernetes

If you have an interest in game, gamification and education technology, you'll fit right in! ðŸŽ®
